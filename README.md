# Integrated Disease Prediction and E-Appointment Schedular with Admin Panel
## Overview
This project is designed to improve healthcare access in rural areas by leveraging machine learning to optimize appointment scheduling and providing an intuitive admin panel for healthcare providers. It addresses challenges like limited medical resources, long travel distances, and irregular availability of healthcare professionals, ensuring more efficient and accessible service delivery.
   
## Features
1. Machine Learning Integration: Predicts and optimizes appointment schedules based on various factors.
2. Admin Panel: Intuitive interface for healthcare providers to manage appointments and resources.
3. Backend Development: Developed in Java for robust and scalable server-side functionality.
4. ML Models in Python: Used for predictive analytics and optimization tasks.
5. User-Centric Design: Simplifies healthcare management, ensuring a better experience for providers and patients.
   
## Technologies Used
> Backend: Java
> Machine Learning: Python
> Database: MySQ
> Frontend: React, HTML/CSS, JavaScript

## Installation
1. Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git  
2. Set up the backend: Install Java and your preferred IDE (e.g., IntelliJ, Eclipse). Configure the database and update the connection strings in the backend code.
4. Set up the machine learning models: Install Python and the required libraries: pip install -r requirements.txt  
5. Run the application: Start the backend server. Deploy or serve the admin panel frontend.

## Usage
1. Healthcare Providers:
